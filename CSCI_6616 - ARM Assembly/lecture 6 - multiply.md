## Mutiply

3. Several A32 Multiply Instructions Are Available
A32 refers to the ARM architecture's 32-bit instruction set. In this instruction set, multiple multiply instructions are available to perform various types of multiplication, including:

Basic multiplication (mul).
* Multiply-accumulate operations (mla, muls, etc.).
* ARM provides a range of multiply instructions for different purposes:

* mul: Basic multiplication of two registers.
* mla (Multiply-Accumulate): Multiplies two registers and adds the result to another register.
* muls: Multiplies and stores the result into a destination register.
* smulbb, smulbt, smultb, etc.: Signed multiplication variants.
* umull, smlal, etc.: Variants for long multiplication or accumulating with signed and unsigned operands.
